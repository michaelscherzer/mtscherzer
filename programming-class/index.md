Our three girls are homeschooled (mostly by my [lovely wife](https://aliensintheapple.com/)), and we're part of a Christian homeschooling co-op that meets every second Friday. After the first year in the co-op, one of the parents is required to help with or teach a class. So for the 2016-2017 school year, I offered to teach a computers and programming class to a group of ten high school age students.

Below is the course outline, with links to my "teaching notes" for each session:

1. [Introduction and History](01-introduction/): introduction to the course, expectations, what computers are, a very brief history of computing
2. [Computer Components](02-components/): break a computer apart to show them the components, explain briefly what each part does
3. [Numbers, Binary, and Computer Math](03-numbers/)
4. [Networks and the Internet](04-networks/)
5. [More About the Web](05-more-web/)
6. [Introduction to Python](06-intro-to-python/)
7. [Control Structures](07-control-structures/)
8. [Lists](08-lists/): a look at the "list" container data type
9. [Grammar and Dictionaries](09-grammar-and-dicts/)
10. Going Over the Homework
11. [Programming Careers](11-careers/)
12. Turtle Graphics
13. More Turtle Graphics
14. [Review Quiz](14-review-quiz/)
15. Sine Wave Roads
16. [Recursion](16-recursion/)
