> These are my "teaching notes" for the second session of my [Computers and Programming Class](/programming-class/). This class was pretty hands-on, so my notes here are very light (I brought an old desktop PC to the class and discussed how each component worked).


Power supply
------------

* Takes 110 volt AC power from the wall and turns it into 12 volt DC and 5 volt DC for the computer and its components.
* Explain AC (alternating current) versus DC (direct current) electricity.
* Explain briefly how it rectifies the AC, chops it up into a high-frequency signal, and converts the voltage down using a transformer.
* The power supply doesn't have a computer in it; it's controlled by a fairly "simple" circuit to keep the voltages stable.


Hard drive
----------

* Hard drives are long-term storage for your data: documents, photos, programs, etc.
* They don't lose information when your computers is off.
* Traditional hard drives have a bunch of metal discs with a huge number of tiny magnetizable "tracks". The discs spin, and read/write heads move back and forth to read or write data into the right places, making full use of the disc.
* These days more and more hard drives are SSDs (solid state drives) which work using fancy chips instead of magnetic, so there are no moving parts and they're much faster. But they're still more expensive: about 3-4x the price of magnetic hard drives.
* 1 terabyte or 1 trillion bytes on a hard drive. A byte is enough storage for one English letter, or for one small number. (We'll talk more about binary next time.)


CD/DVD drive
------------

* Optical storage drive for very long-term stuff: movies, programs, etc.
* A laser cuts tiny indentations or *pits* into the plastic disc. Then a similar laser reads data back off the disc by how the light reflects: the flat parts of the disc reflect light, the pits scatter it.
* They're spinning discs with read/write heads similar to a hard drive.
* 700 megabytes for a CD, 4 gigabytes for a DVD, 25 gigabytes for a Blu-ray disc.


Motherboard
-----------

* The brains of the computer are on the motherboard -- it holds the CPU (central processing unit, the main computer chip), the RAM memory, the graphics chip, network chip, etc.
* The motherboard has slots for add-ons or "daughter boards", for example a specialized graphics card or sound card.
* There's a little battery for remembering clock time.
* All the components and tracks or wires connecting components must be very carefully designed, because of the high frequencies the computer operates at.


Central processing unit
-----------------------

* Operates at a very high frequency: maybe 2.4 GHz or 3 GHz. These are the speeds we talked about last week.
* Runs the software: executes machine instructions to add or subtract numbers, to jump to new instructions ("go back to step 3", "repeat"), move numbers in and out of RAM memory.
* Has *registers* (super fast memory) and a *cache* (fast memory). Only when it runs out of these days it need to use main RAM (still fast, but much slower than cache memory or registers).
* Designed by putting together blocks, each of which is a complicated circuit with thousands of transistors. In total, a modern CPU has about 1.5 *billion* transistors.


RAM (memory)
------------

* This is short-term storage for temporary data when the computer is on. As soon as you turn the power off, it forgets everything.
* RAM is fast! Not as fast as registers or CPU cache, but much faster than hard drives.
* Modern personal computers have between 2 gigabytes and 32 gigabytes of RAM. Some tiny computer chips for use inside devices like microwaves have only a few hundred bytes of RAM.


Ports
-----

* Don't forget these! They're for connecting external devices to your computer, so without them you couldn't interact with the computer.
* Monitor (VGA or HDMI port)
* USB (for keyboards, mice, exteral drives, etc)
* Network (ethernet)
* Headphones/microphone
* Any other ports?


Monitor
-------

* In the "olden days" monitors were CRT (cathode ray tube). How did these work? A "gun" that fires electrons towards a screen that glows when hit. The gun scans back and forth across the whole screen about 60 times per second.
* Nowaways all monitors are LCD or "flat screen". These have little transistors to turn each pixel on and off, and there's a light in the back of your screen that creates the actual light.
* For each dot or pixel on screen, there are three little vertical bars that one color through: red, green, blue. The combination and amounts of light coming through each of these makes the different colors.


Keyboard and mouse
------------------

Your homework for next week is to make a one-page explanation of how a keyboard or mouse works. You can choose to do either keyboard or mouse, but pick one and research how it works online, and make a one-page explanation using your own diagrams and words. Just sketches and hand-written notes are fine, but it needs to be legible.
