Jobs in computer programming
----------------------------

One of the great things about computer programming is that there are a lot of jobs out there, and they pay very well. This course isn't going to land you a job, but if you do want to study computer programming at college (they call it *computer science*) or even on your own after this, you'll have a head start.

To get a computer programming job, it helps to have a college degree, but if you're a go-getter even that's not required -- mainly you have to show people what you can build.

What kinds of jobs are available?

1. You could work at a startup company, and help them build their website. Usually that doesn't mean just a simple web page, but develop the databases and code for a custom website that performs something useful, say Gmail for example, or a shopping website, or a website that helps you manage your money.

2. You could work at a large, established company like Google or Microsoft. At a large company you'd usually be building a small piece of what they do, for example the chat feature of Gmail, or the login screen for Windows 10.

3. And you could work in entertainment or video games, for example working on the 3D graphics for a Pixar movie, or helping write the next version of Angry Birds.

4. You could work in finance, meaning write computer programs to move money around, that sort of thing.

5. You could work in science, writing programs that analyze weather information, or that help researchers find patterns in data, or that simulate someone's heart beating.

6. You could work in *embedded programming*, meaning writing programs for the tiny microchips that go inside microwaves, mobile phones, cars, etc.

So there's a lot out there, and I just wanted to whet your appetite. Again, you won't be able to get a job just from this course, but hopefully you'll have a head start if you do want to head in that direction. If not, let's just have fun learning!
