<p class="gap">U<span class="smallcaps">nforgettable</span> <span class="smallcaps">Sudan</span>.</p>


<p class="gap">T<span class="smallcaps">he first stop</span>, of course, was the airport. Franci
was right there to meet me, and that wasn&rsquo;t a small thing. Few other women were
allowed in that far, but her taraha was covering her hair, and she&rsquo;d spoken some
smooth Arabic to the guards.</p>

<p>On the way out of the country there were countless
passport checks, but this way there was only one. Well, if you can count a
forty-five minute wait as &ldquo;one.&rdquo; All the locals went straight on out, but we foreigners
were directed away from the main queue to a tiny room nearby. It was no bigger
than a small kitchen, but in it there was an Arabic-speaking television, one
unused computer, two sizeable desks, and four or five important-looking officials.
(Only the TV was doing anything
useful.) I honestly couldn&rsquo;t see what the hold-up was. My better half had to reawaken
my patience with three words that became a refrain: <em>Welcome to Sudan.</em></p>

<p>In the meantime, though, we got to watch
some superlative Sudanese stamping. After spending many minutes examining the
invisible fine print on my visa, the head official would pick up a large stamp,
sponge it two or three times on the ink, lift it as high as his head, and slam
it down into my passport. For just one hundred US dollars,
we were entitled to three such demonstrations, with a
fourth thrown in for free.</p>

<p>One thing I learnt as soon as we&rsquo;d left the
airport: Khartoum airport and Khartoum city are two very different beasts. The
airport is slow, official, and hostile; the city is swarming, human, and very
friendly.</p>


<p class="gap">F<span class="smallcaps">or the next</span> two weeks, my eyes were wide
with adventure. Sudan was more different from New Zealand than difference
itself.</p>

<p>The excitement began immediately, with the
taxi that carried us from the airport to a friend&rsquo;s place. Driving here was
like a movie-style car chase, weaving between people and traffic, only in very slow
motion. And apparently it was quite normal for one&rsquo;s taxi door to swing chaotically
open and shut. The first time I nearly fell out. I prayed that my luggage would
stay in the boot till we arrived, because its door had a similar problem.
Despite all this, I felt surprisingly safe. I began to realise: this is a rare
experience, this is amazing, this is fun! It was time for the refrain: <em>Welcome
to Sudan.</em></p>

<p>During my first few days there, the school kids
were having a short break, so Franci and the other teachers didn&rsquo;t have to
work. Four of us managed to arrange an overnight desert trip with a local driver.
(I say &ldquo;driver&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;tour guide&rdquo; because I&rsquo;m not sure &ldquo;tourist&rdquo; means
much there; where we went they get a mere four hundred per year.) I&rsquo;m sure our driver
spoke Arabic to his two wives and six children, but his English was good enough
to enlighten us with commentary.</p>

<p>Khartoum is a city
on a river. The White Nile from the South meets the Blue Nile from Ethiopia,
and the two form The Nile, which wanders on to Egypt. (Even most painters don&rsquo;t
realise it, but white and blue mix to form muddy-brown.) Despite the water, the
whole city is red and brown, filled with a strange kind of stark, dusty beauty.
I hardly knew what had hit me; still less would a Sudanese man coming to New Zealand
realise what had hit him. When I got home, even I was knocked a bit: I
discovered those super-green photographs in our touristy books are real after
all. Creation is grand!</p>

<p>On our half-day journey into the desert there
were three kinds of stops: for sightseeing, for eating, and for Coke. You can
go to Australia, India, Brazil, Kenya or Sudan, but you can&rsquo;t escape Coca-Cola.<sup>&reg;</sup>
I suppose the warring Darfur tribes don&rsquo;t have Coke, but there sure was enough
of it around Khartoum. It even tastes like our stuff. What&rsquo;s weirdest, though,
is the Coke logo in Arabic: it looks just like the English letters JESUS.
American capitalists have done some good missionary work.</p>

<p>Another piece of globalism here was Toyota. Each and every taxi in Khartoum was a yellow
1980&rsquo;s Toyota Corolla. Huge, late-model Land Cruisers were not rare
either; the only difference is that in Khartoum, unlike Wellington, they
actually make sense. Even in the city the roads can get pretty rough, and in
the desert our 4WD was really cruising the land.</p>


<p class="gap">A<span class="smallcaps">t our first</span> few stops we were introduced to
the nomads: the people whose home is the desert and whose tiny dwellings are
made of canvas and sticks. We met the first family (or perhaps they met us?)
near the woven tent that gave them shade. It made me wonder: their whole abode
was smaller than my garden shed. Yet &ldquo;their land&rdquo; was much bigger than mine;
this family could move anywhere they wanted at the drop of a hat, or the death
of a goat. (The couple had three kids and two other kids. I&rsquo;ll leave it as an
exercise to the reader to discover which were goats and which were children.)
I&rsquo;m not sure if the nomads saw us as intruders or friends. They couldn&rsquo;t speak
a word of English, so we could communicate only by giving treats to their children.
<em>Welcome to Sudan,</em> I thought.</p>

<p>In a sense I envied these people, living
off the stark no-man&rsquo;s land in a house they could pack into their bags. Everything
they owned could be carried by them or by their boney donkey. They live the
simple life, the stress-free life. But do I really envy them? There&rsquo;s not much
I&rsquo;d miss, but I would miss my books. My books are worlds, dreams and hopes. I&rsquo;d
miss having The Book. The nomads had none: not books, not The Book; they didn&rsquo;t
even have the Koran. Perhaps it&rsquo;s like this: they have small curses and small
blessings, whereas we own some pretty big curses, but we also get big
blessings. Small is beautiful, but for now we must be content with the beauty
of big.</p>


<p class="gap">W<span class="smallcaps">e stopped</span> for the night about a hundred
kilometres north of Khartoum, just under the Nubian Pyramids. They sure were something.
Or something else, to save confusion with the larger but less steep Egyptian
Pyramids. Some of the Nubian structures had seventy-degree sides, and were still
twenty or thirty metres up. They were stair-like constructions made of large,
perhaps two-hundred kilogram, bricks. Apparently they were sacred enough that
we weren&rsquo;t supposed to climb them, but not enough that our guide remembered to
tell us this before we tried.</p>

<p>Much like the Egyptian ones, the pyramids
here were tombs of kings, built around 300 BC (some of the Egyptian pyramids are as old as
2500 BC). Much later, around 1820 AD, the
infamous Giuseppe &ldquo;Mafia&rdquo; Ferlini gave the pyramids rather bold haircuts; many
of them are now more rubble than structure. And apparently he only found one
little cache of gold.</p>

<p>The best thing about the Nubian versus the
Egyptian pyramids is that they were ninety-nine percent tourist-free. So was
our camping site. No Asians with busy cameras, no Americans with busy mouths,
and no Departments of Conservation with busy donation boxes. It was nothing
like camping in New Zealand; there we were under the stars on the sand, with
pyramids and dunes all around us. Sleeping bags would have been unthinkable,
and rain wasn&rsquo;t even in a corner of the sky.</p>

<p>Somehow the local peddlers still managed to
find us. I didn&rsquo;t even have to think it before one of the others said it: <em>Welcome
to Sudan.</em> There they were, at the crack of dawn, even before we&rsquo;d had
breakfast. (Here in the desert, &ldquo;crack of dawn&rdquo; is not a metaphor. In some of
the Northern, remoter parts of Africa, you can actually hear a faint but distint
<em>crack</em> as the sun appears above the horizon. Helo-spectologists are
unsure what causes this, but the Nubians believe it is the whip of the divine
Camel Owner spurring on his camel, which is the sun.) We didn&rsquo;t spend up large
on trinkets, but I think they still did pretty well out of us. I bought a dangerously
sharp knife at which, surprisingly, the New Zealand customs officials didn&rsquo;t
even flinch. What I wonder is where and how they use the money in the desert; I
guess someone exchanges it at the nearest town, or perhaps trades with someone
heading for Khartoum.</p>

<p>So head there we did. One of the highlights
on the trip back was stopping at a market: a huge, diverse collection of stalls
and shops, with much the same purpose as a mall in the West. Only this was far
better. Things were earthy and real, nothing plastic or glitzy about them. You
could buy almost anything: fruit, grains, shoes, fabric, clothing, trinkets,
gold, and even cellphones.</p>

<p>The amount of gold at the Khartoum markets was
breathtaking. At one market there was an entire block of stalls selling pure
gold. Millions of twenty-four carat creations, sold by the gram. It wasn&rsquo;t
cheap, but I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;d make a fair profit if you bought some and sold it
here. Then again, our jewellers mark their items up no end: fifty-percent-off
sales are common here, whereas in Khartoum prices are probably far more steady.
The Sudanese women dress in beautiful colours, and they love their gold. With
gold, weight makes right. Some of the poorer women, when they go out, will wear
all the gold they own, trying to prove their worth. Still, it&rsquo;s hardly worse
than our fashions.</p>


<p class="gap">A<span class="smallcaps">ll this time</span> it was very hot. Insanely hot!
Not just a little bit warm; I&rsquo;m talking a solid, draining, inescapable Heat
that words can&rsquo;t convey. During the day it was commonly 43 degrees (that&rsquo;s 110 degrees
for those who were schooled in the unmetricated country).</p>

<p>After the trip the teachers put me straight
on the front lines. I was to help out at the school, in the pre-school class,
or &ldquo;the nursery,&rdquo; as the American teachers were fond of calling it. (I kept
thinking of a place where you breed young trees.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that I love children, but it
sure is tough to run around with four-year-olds in forty degrees. The school
started early, about seven-thirty, and finished not long after noon. Relatively
speaking, I felt absolutely drained the whole day. Murphy and his Laws must
have an Arab counterpart, for as soon as it was time to go home, I was as
chirpy as ever. <em>Welcome to Sudan.</em></p>

<p>One thing I didn&rsquo;t exactly learn, but had
reinforced: kids are the same everywhere. You toss them up, you sing with them,
you play games, and despite Original Sin, they love you for it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter
much what language they speak, or whether there&rsquo;s dust instead of grass under
their feet. It doesn&rsquo;t even matter how hot it is.</p>

<p>When I got back and told all my comfortable
Kiwi friends about the heat, almost every one said, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a dry heat,
right? At least it&rsquo;s better than a humid one.&rdquo; Granted, bad is better than
worse, but I&rsquo;d honestly rather have good. I&rsquo;m sure &ldquo;bad&rdquo;
would take a solid twelve months to get used to.</p>

<p>At this point I really must stop in my red,
dusty tracks: Why am I being so negative? I raved about my two weeks in Sudan,
and I plan to for the rest of my life. I loved it. I&rsquo;d think about moving there next
month if it weren&rsquo;t for the heat. Well, and maybe friends and family and
church. Oh, and our wedding. And perhaps the green, and the mountain snow, and
clear rivers, and Masterton sunsets. But seriously, Sudan was wonderful, and
any bad points were outweighed by the beauty of Africa and the Arab
friendliness.</p>


<p class="gap">T<span class="smallcaps">hese days</span> that concept needs repeating: &ldquo;Arab
friendliness&rdquo; is far from a contradiction. The Sudanese, if they were nothing
else, were friendly. We think we Kiwis are easy-going and easy to get along
with, but what I saw here really expanded my mind.</p>

<p>You walk down the street and feel it
immediately: <em>Welcome to Sudan.</em> You enter a shop and they&rsquo;ll go out of
their way to help you, and not just to get your money. I had to buy a Sudanese SIM
card for my cellphone, and the young man we first talked to didn&rsquo;t have one,
but he walked us ten minutes down the road to a place that had them, got one for
us, walked us all the way back, made us sit down, and then topped it all off
by buying us each a nice glass of Khartoum lemonade. Talk about service.</p>

<p>When Franci was engaged in the evenings
(with something else, not to someone else), I would walk round our block and
see what I could see. Khartoum night life was incredible: even till eleven and
twelve o&rsquo;clock, the young men would hang out, just talking and laughing, at the
local caf&eacute;s and bars. But these are no ordinary bars. This is Sudan, non-alcoholic
Muslim country, so we&rsquo;re talking Juice Bars. You could tell, too: here
was a chatty, green-light district that felt safe, not seedy.</p>

<p>The guys would wave at me and call &ldquo;Hallo
hwaja!&rdquo; (&ldquo;Gidday white stranger!&rdquo;) Some would pretend to be shy when I returned
with my attempt at an Arabic greeting. Others would begin a conversation by showing
off their three phrases of broken English. I made more than one friend this way.</p>

<p>We certainly have a lot to learn about
neighbourliness. Part of our problem, I believe, is our love of steel cages on
wheels. Sure, there are plenty even in Khartoum, but thousands more people
walk. Walking can be a ticket to making friends, to meeting neighbours, and to
acting out the Good Samaritan (we had the chance to do all of these a number of
times, even in the few days I was there). Apart from hitch-hiking, which is
becoming increasingly dangerous, it&rsquo;s pretty hard to make new friends while
driving. Then again, it&rsquo;s not that cars have no place; but in a city, and if
you want serious community, it&rsquo;s a pretty small place.</p>

<p>Seeing I&rsquo;m preaching already: Which city
would you choose, Auckland or Khartoum? I know where I&rsquo;d rather be. I know
where I&rsquo;d sooner let my fianc&eacute;e walk at night. And I know where I&rsquo;d be more
likely to meet and help strangers. Here we are, living in the wake of One who
said to love our neighbour, but even in little Masterton, we don&rsquo;t say hello to
the people next door more than once a month.</p>

<p>Another big part of the problem is things,
or at least how we use them (though I&rsquo;m not sure the two can be separated). I&rsquo;m
thinking especially of watches and televisions. These thoughts are not exactly
my own; I gleaned them from books and am filling in the blanks.</p>

<p>In Khartoum, watches and clocks hardly
featured, and I noticed the effects of this almost straight away. At first it
was frustrating, because the bank took three times as long to process anything.
But after a few days you realise that you&rsquo;re not rushing everywhere, and that
you&rsquo;ve hardly been thinking about time at all. The fourth dimension was not a
tight-rope but a slack-line, and to walk it felt bouncy and exhilarating. The
sceptic might say this was because I was on &ldquo;holiday,&rdquo; but I noticed that most
everyone strolled on the slack-line.</p>

<p>Just like back home, even some of the
poorer Sudanese families have TV, but the broadcasts available are quite different
to ours. They have propaganda of their own, but boxed Western shallowness is not
as widely available. People are forced to do other things, like drinking juice
with friends till midnight. I&rsquo;m not one to suggest killing your TV or smashing
your watch, but I believe we need to think seriously about the impact they have
in our life and culture.</p>


<p class="gap">S<span class="smallcaps">peaking of juice</span> bars reminds me:
Khartoum fruit juice is far and away the best in the world. Most groups of shops would have
two or three fruit juice stalls. One of the most popular was called Tweety
Juice. Weird name, but hey, <em>Welcome to Sudan.</em> I can&rsquo;t prove it, but I&rsquo;m
guessing they minced up little chirping sparrows and threw them in for extra protein.</p>

<p>Though the juice cost less than you&rsquo;d pay
for Just Juice back home, it was not cheap, but it was spectacular. An order
went something like this: ask for a strawberry-banana mix, then watch. They&rsquo;ll
grab some fresh strawberries from the shelf above, throw them in a blender with
a bit of ice, add a banana or two, shake in a dash of sugar, wait about sixty
seconds, and there you have it. Rich and fresh. Thicker than the thickest milkshake.</p>

<p>I can just imagine their juice being
advertised for the New Zealand market: A ruggedly handsome guy jumps in his
truck and calls to his friend, &ldquo;Catch you at Tweety&rsquo;s for a cold one, mate!&rdquo;
Then a scene of the two of them sitting around a table with their mugs full of
thick fruit pulp. Finally the slogan in a deep voice: &ldquo;Tweety&rsquo;s. A man&rsquo;s
juice.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="gap">A<span class="smallcaps">ll in all</span>, my trip was a brilliant Overseas
Experience. We Kiwis are fond of our OEs: our stints to Australia, or Europe, or maybe America. But since I&rsquo;ve been back, I&rsquo;m recommending that people go
somewhere completely different. Somewhere strange, somewhere Third World, somewhere
you haven&rsquo;t seen on TV or in the tourist magazines. Your eyes will be opened, and
your ears will hear. Even if you go to give, you will receive in abundance. You
will come back A Wiser Being.</p>

<p>Go, book the next flight to Khartoum, and hear it for yourself: <em>Welcome to Sudan.</em></p>
