I recently read Paul Graham's [tweet](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1547698706161344516) about how founders who fail are usually admired, as long as they made something good, and understand why they failed.

When two of my brothers and I launched our crowdfunding startup microPledge in 2007, we certainly believed we were making something good. The idea of a crowdfunding platform was great; our execution not so much.

And I believe we know why we failed: our first version was ridiculously complex rather than a "minimum viable product", and we created it before trying to sell and test it with potential users. Then there was the PayPal legal battle which finished us off.

This article provides an overview of our startup, digs into our mistakes and what we learned, and gives a timeline of events for the record. It also looks at why Kickstarter -- a similar idea -- took off, where microPledge did not. What microPledge did do, however, was *kickstart* our careers.


## Overview of microPledge

* Origin, Ber's idea on the way to work
* good timing: "crowdfunding" as a term
* a software focus
* three brothers
* investors (Geoff, family)
* why was it good (the competition)


## Why we failed

### Overcomplicated

* product design, or lack thereof (three engineers, no product people)
* slider, voting, upload evidence, ... what were we thinking?
* Kickstarter and others just had "pledge!"
* way overengineered for an MVP

### Not selling or talking to users

### Our PayPal legal battle

We paid, but they were no "pal".



## Attempting to sell company IP


## What we learned

### Technical

* Learned: Python, web dev, web.py, databases/SQL
* Diff testing (Ber's idea)

### Business

* Business experience: Brush
* Startup experience (did many things better with Hivemind)
* KISS for product; KISS for engineering (MVP)
* Test on real users
* Sell first
* Be in Silicon Valley or have U.S. connections
* If we were doing it again, would we have succeeded?



## Timeline


## Conclusion

* Why Kickstarter succeeded (kudos to them)
* Blah blah
