<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p class="subtitle">September 1999</p>

<p class="gap">Winter mocks as spring tries to press through in vain.<br>
Dusk unfolds; grey clouds murmur dissent as they rush away,<br>
Uncovering the insidiously pale, dimming blue.<br>
The pink of the horizon provides a receding glimmer of hope.

<p>Darkness has now clambered across the sky,<br>
Uranus and Neptune are whispering unheard wisdom.<br>
The Bringer of War drums out rhythms of mankind&rsquo;s destruction,<br>
While the mind flickers like a star between order and pandemonium.

<p>Anarchistic evil is portrayed by the shooting stars:<br>
A gunman&rsquo;s outward apparel soon smothered by blackness.<br>
Across the sky flows the band of the Milky Way,<br>
But its richness is destroyed by ravenous dictators.

<p>This bleak picture, painted on a palette blue and grey,<br>
Covers all goodness and love, hiding the Creator in pretension.<br>
Man deceives himself into cruelty and violence,<br>
A deceptive praying mantis uttering zealous words.

<p>The tired, contorted soul languishes into sleep,<br>
Dreams come with the dew, and dread dies with soft echoes.<br>
Later, the Morning Star rises, restoring peace and harmony,<br>
And melancholy vanishes in the first rays of a vernal sun.
