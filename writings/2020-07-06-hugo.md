<p>Static web-site generators take page content written in a markup
language and render it into fully baked HTML, making it easy for developers
to upload the result and serve a web site simply and
securely. This article looks at <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, a
static-site generator written in Go and optimized for speed. It is a
flexible tool that can be configured for a variety of use cases: simple
blogs, project documentation, larger news sites, and even government
services.</p>


<h4>Background</h4>

<p>Static-site generators have probably been around since the invention of
HTML: most sites have a common header and footer, and site owners don't
want to copy and paste that manually into each of their pages. Back then,
developers would be more likely to write a few dozen lines of custom Perl
or Bash to string their HTML together. That approach definitely works, but
today's static-site generators are faster and more powerful than a simple
custom script.</p>

<p>A lot of sites handle common headers (and the like) by dynamically
rendering the content for every page view; for example, by using PHP
connected to a database. In 2020, developers might be more likely to use a
<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> frontend connected to an HTTP API
that serves the content. Both of these setups, however, are overkill when a
site just needs to serve some mostly static content.</p>

<p>Many personal sites and blogs, as well as project and company
documentation sites, can be generated statically. Serving pre-rendered HTML
is faster and more reliable than serving dynamically rendered
content. Wikipedia lists some of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page#Advantages_of_a_static_website">advantages</a>
that static web sites provide:</p>

<div class="BigQuote">
<ul class="spacylist">
    <li>Improved security over dynamic websites (dynamic websites are at risk to web shell attacks if a vulnerability is present)</li>
    <li>Improved performance for end users compared to dynamic websites</li>
    <li>Fewer or no dependencies on systems such as databases or other application servers</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Of course, some web sites (particularly web applications) will always
require dynamic content. Even LWN, where the article contents are static,
needs to be able to serve different content for logged-in subscribers and
non-logged-in visitors. So there will always be a need for dynamic servers
and APIs. But when a site's content is static and public, or when any
dynamic content can be handled on the client side, a static-site generator
can significantly simplify the system.</p>

<p>Because static-site generators are relatively easy to build, there are
many open-source options available. All of the major programming languages
have fairly popular offerings, for example: <a
href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> in Ruby, <a
href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> in Python, <a
href="https://jbake.org/">JBake</a> in Java, <a
href="https://sculpin.io/">Sculpin</a> in PHP, <a
href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a> in JavaScript, as well as <a
href="https://www.staticgen.com/">hundreds of others</a>. Here we look at
Hugo, which is an active and well-maintained open-source project.</p>

<p>Hugo was created in 2013 by Steve Francia (now a member of the core Go
team), but Bj√∏rn Erik Pedersen took over as the lead developer in 2015. The
project is <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">hosted on GitHub</a>;
it is currently 43,000 lines of Go source (excluding comments) licensed
under the permissive Apache License&nbsp;2.0. It has a thorough <a
href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/">documentation site</a> built, of
course, using Hugo. The project also has plenty of involvement from
the community, with a relatively high-traffic <a
href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/">discussion forum</a> and a large number
of user-submitted <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">themes</a>. Pedersen
<a
href="https://www.tnd.dev/article/2017-10-03-interview-hugo-lead-developer/">said</a>
in 2017 that Hugo's infrastructure (but not development) has some corporate
sponsorship, "<span>Netlify hosts our sites for free and Discourse keeps
the forum running. Travis, Appveyor and CircleCI for builds. But other than
that, no sponsors.</span>"</p>

<p>It doesn't matter too much what programming language a site generator is
written in (I personally use Jekyll but have never needed to write Ruby),
though developers often lean toward a tool that's written in a language
they're familiar with. Even if a developer uses Hugo, they will probably
never have to write Go, though if they are building or customizing a theme,
they may need to dip into Go's <a
href="https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/">HTML templating
syntax</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/Hugo">According to
BuiltWith</a>, Hugo usage has grown sharply over the last three years. It
is used by several notable projects, including the <a
href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/a-little-surprise-is-waiting-for-you-here/">redesigned
Smashing Magazine site</a>, the <a
href="https://gohugo.io/showcase/1password-support/">1Password Support
site</a> and <a
href="https://blog.1password.com/better-faster-stronger-our-new-blog-and-how-we-made-it/">blog</a>,
the <a
href="https://twitter.com/letsencrypt/status/971755920639307777">Let's
Encrypt</a> web site, as well as the <a
href="https://github.com/GSA/digitalgov.gov#development-guide">US
government's Digital.gov site</a>.</p>


<h4>How it works</h4>

<p>When run without options, <tt>hugo</tt> traverses the <a
href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>
files in the <tt>content</tt> subdirectory and outputs rendered HTML to a
subdirectory named <tt>public</tt>. All of this is configurable &mdash; the
default config file is <tt>config.toml</tt> in the root of the
project. Output is rendered according to a theme, which is a handful of
Go HTML templates that define exactly what HTML is generated. The theme
includes CSS styling as well as any images or JavaScript files needed for
the theme.</p>

<p>Before writing this article, I set up a <a
href="https://d2fhg5pkhfbcuz.cloudfront.net/">simple test site</a> with
three articles and an "About" page &mdash; the kind of thing one might use
for a personal web site or blog. It took about 30 minutes to choose a
theme, configure Hugo, and add some dummy content. Hugo <a
href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/">can be installed</a>
from popular operating system package managers, pre-built binaries on
GitHub (for Linux, various BSDs, macOS, and Windows), or built from
source. For Hugo, building from source is as simple as installing Go (if it
is not already installed), cloning the project, and typing <tt>go
build</tt>. On my machine it took about 20 seconds from clone to running
"<tt>hugo&nbsp;version</tt>".</p>

<p>During development, typing "<tt>hugo&nbsp;server</tt>" starts a local web
server to serve the rendered content from RAM. In this mode, Hugo
automatically watches the files and rebuilds the HTML as needed. There's even some
JavaScript in the rendered page to automatically reload it in the web
browser as soon as that piece of content is changed (using <a
href="https://github.com/livereload/livereload-js">LiveReload</a> with a
web socket). Hugo's built-in server is based on the production-ready <a
href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/"><tt>net/http</tt></a> server, but it's usually
simpler for deployment to pre-build and upload the rendered files to a
static-site host such as Amazon S3, or serve them behind a regular web
server such as <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">NGINX</a>.</p>

<p>Like other static-site generators, Hugo uses a simple file format for
pages that consists of "front matter" in YAML format, separated from the
Markdown content by "<tt>---</tt>" lines. Here is the content for the <a
href="https://d2fhg5pkhfbcuz.cloudfront.net/posts/my-first-post/">first
post</a> of my example site:</p>

<pre>

    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Ee equals em cee squared.
    Let's try a [link](https://benhoyt.com/) and **some bold text**.

    Another paragraph. Hugo seems to be working. Writing Markdown is nice.
</pre>

<p>To give an idea of what a Hugo theme template looks like, here's the
<tt>single.html</tt> template that's part of the <a
href="https://themes.gohugo.io/soho/">Soho</a> theme I used in my test (it
renders a single blog article):</p>

<pre>
    {{ define &quot;main&quot; -}}
    &lt;div class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/h1&gt;

      {{ if ne .Type &quot;page&quot; -}}
      &lt;div class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;
        &lt;time datetime=&quot;{{ .Date.Format &quot;2006-01-02T15:04:05Z0700&quot; }}&quot;&gt;
            {{ .Date.Format &quot;Jan 2, 2006&quot; }}
        &lt;/time&gt;
        &amp;middot; {{ .ReadingTime }} min read
      &lt;/div&gt;
      {{- end }}

      {{ .Content }}
    &lt;/div&gt;
    {{- end }}
</pre>

<p>Hugo supports "taxonomies", which are different ways of categorizing
pages, and for each taxonomy it creates a page that lists all the articles
with that taxonomy assigned. By default it creates "tags" and "categories"
taxonomies, for example the "<a
href="https://d2fhg5pkhfbcuz.cloudfront.net/categories/development/">Development</a>"
category on my test site. The <a
href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/">documentation</a>
shows various ways of ordering taxonomies or adding metadata to them.</p>

<p>The tool supports various ways to control page URLs ("permalinks") in
the rendered content, with the default of <tt>/:section/:filename/</tt>
producing URLs like <tt>/posts/third-article/</tt>.
The <tt>:section</tt> name comes from the subdirectory name in
<tt>content</tt> (e.g. <tt>posts</tt>), while <tt>:filename</tt> is the name of the file where the
content came from without any extension. 
These "directory URLs"
are done by creating the rendered HTML file in a directory with an index
file: <tt>/posts/third-article/index.html</tt>.</p>

<p>One of the more advanced features of Hugo is what it calls "<a
href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/">shortcodes</a>",
which are small snippets of HTML (with parameters) that can be used to
augment Markdown's limited functionality without falling back to
HTML. There are many builtin shortcodes, for example <tt>gist</tt> (to
include a GitHub Gist), <tt>highlight</tt> (syntax-highlighted code), and
<tt>youtube</tt> (an inline YouTube video). For example, the following
shortcode:</p>

<pre>
    {{&lt; youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc &gt;}}
</pre>

<p>will produce this HTML output:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/w7Ft2ymGmfc?autoplay=1&quot;
          style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&quot;
          allowfullscreen title=&quot;YouTube Video&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>Hugo also includes more advanced features such as generating a <a
href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/toc/">table of contents</a> from
the headings within an article, alternative <a
href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#list-of-content-formats">markup
formats</a> (Markdown is the default), a <a
href="https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/">pipeline</a> for pre-processing CSS and JavaScript, and <a
href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/">image
processing</a> commands to resize and crop images.</p>

<p>Hugo is billed as being fast, with its home page saying "<span>at
&lt;1 ms per page, the average site builds in less than a
second</span>". Smashing Magazine's 7500-page site <a
href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/smashing-magazine-s-redesign-powered-by-hugo-jamstack/5826/9">apparently</a>
built in around 13 seconds. This speed is due in part to it being written
in Go, a language that compiles to native binaries (rather than a
bytecode-interpreted language like Python), but also partly due to various
benchmarking and performance efforts that contributors have made over the
years; for example, see the <a
href="https://gohugo.io/news/0.63.0-relnotes/">release notes</a> for
version 0.63 released in January 2020.</p>

<p>In general with static-site generators, content authors need to be
developers, or at least be familiar with using a text editor, Markdown, and
Git. However, web host Netlify has an open-source tool called <a
href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify CMS</a> that allows
non-developers to contribute using a WYSIWYG editor &mdash; the tool
commits to a Git repository behind the scenes. Hugo's documentation has a
<a href="https://gohugo.io/tools/frontends/">list</a> of other similar
tools.</p>


<h4>Hosting options</h4>

<p>With static-site generation, developers can choose to host the rendered
output on any host or web server. Popular options are GitHub Pages, Amazon
S3, Netlify, or self-hosting using the <a
href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> or NGINX web servers. Hugo has 
a <a
href="https://gohugo.io/categories/hosting-and-deployment">documentation
page</a> with detailed setup information for various options.</p>

<p>For my test site, I decided to use Amazon S3 (with AWS's Cloudfront CDN
in front of it). This is pretty simple to set up, and it will handle many
millions of page views for just a few dollars per month. You can of course
avoid the cloud entirely and host on whatever server you have around
&mdash; even a cheap server will be able to serve thousands of static file
requests per second.</p>

<p>It would be straightforward to use continuous integration (for example,
GitHub Actions) to run a Hugo build on every commit to a site's Git
repository, ensuring the rendered version is up to date at all times.</p>


<h4>Wrapping up</h4>

<p>
Hugo doesn't seem to have a public roadmap or fixed release schedule; in
the last couple of years there has been a <a
href="https://gohugo.io/categories/releases">release</a> about every month,
with bug-fix releases in between. In July 2018, Pedersen <a
href="https://gohugo.io/news/lets-celebrate-hugos-5th-birthday/#the-road-to-10">talked
about</a> "the road to 1.0", but right now the maintainers seem to be quite
content with 0.x version numbers. The release names are often
light-hearted, with a "<a
href="https://gohugo.io/news/0.62.0-relnotes/">Christmas Edition</a>" and a
"<a href="https://gohugo.io/news/0.61.0-relnotes/">40K GitHub Stars
Edition</a>".</p>

<p>
Static-site generators are a relatively simple way to build and deploy
web sites with mostly static content. Hugo's speed, permissive license, and
array of features make it an attractive choice for developers, whether it's
for a small personal web site or a large content-heavy one. All in all, Hugo is an active project that is worth keeping an eye
on.</p>
