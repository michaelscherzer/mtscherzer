# Ben Hoyt

I'm married to the only Franci Hoyt in the world, and we and our three lovely daughters live in Christchurch, New Zealand.

By day I'm a software engineer at [Canonical](https://canonical.com/) -- see my [resume/CV](/cv/) for more info.

I've created a few open source [projects](/projects/), and I enjoy writing [technical](/writings/) and [non-technical](/writings/non-tech/) articles.


## Other web sites I run

* [Gifty Weddings](https://giftyweddings.com/), my side business that helps couples make simple wedding gift registries.
* [Aliens in the Apple](https://aliensintheapple.com/) is our family blog, started during our time in New York City.
* [Prism magazine](/prism-magazine/) was a small-scale print magazine I edited back in 2005-2007.
